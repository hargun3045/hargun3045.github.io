> And how you may benefit from knowing it

**Bayes theorem** — The confusing relation you may vaguely remember from high school probability class that made you think, *“When am I going to use any of this in real life?”*

This blog post is my about my journey from medical confusion to clarity, thanks to a simple yet powerful math equation.

So let’s begin with a quick rewind to the year 2017, a year when I was rocking in my first job after college at Cisco Systems, picked up a foreign language in short duration and achieved a promotion after my very first year.

Despite my professional successes, my health was declining, as the city I was living in saw a record increase in pollution, warming and water contamination. 

Such a worsening state of the city had a negative effect on me, as simple jogs around my neighbourhood left me with a perpetually stuffed nose and frequent breathing difficulties leading to headaches and sleepless nights.

<p style="text-align: center;font-style: oblique">Bengaluru, Now a city of <b>frothing</b> lakes</p>

All this took a turn for the worse at the end of the year, as I woke up one Sunday morning, not being able to breathe from either nostril! 
The Emergency physician at a nearby clinic suggested a surgical intervention, that could help me breathe better.

So with that idea, as my company prepared for an end of year shutdown in December, I met the first Otolaryngologist I could find and described to him my troubles. We quickly agreed upon the said surgical intervention (called Septoplasty)

A quick search online for medical reviews on websites such as [realself.com](realself.com) suggested that **about 90%** of those operated upon, approved of the surgery, whic seemed like an impressive statistic.

So within two days, I was in a hospital gown, ready for surgery\! 

**Post Surgery**

According to my doctor, the surgery, apparently, was a success.
I couldn't tell because I had a huge stuffing in my nose.

    <figcaption style="text-align:center">I will survive!</figcaption>
</figure> 


I spent the next two days breathing from my mouth, and finally after painfully waiting for what seemed like a decade, my nose was cleared and ready to pump air\!

But even then, I didn’t feel like I gained anything at all. My questions and concerns were politely ignored, and the doctor said it usually takes about 4 weeks for full breathing function to resume.   

Four weeks passed away, but the response by my surgeon remained the same. “It takes time”, and after some time, I stopped getting any responses from him.

So I kept waiting, but my symptoms exacerbated. I can’t explain what happened, but I felt unusually fatigued, more breathless and with a general sense of malaise.

I spent the following three months, meeting all sorts of doctors, with an honest attempt to find answers, but the trend appeared as though a doctor with a particular speciality, somehow diagnosed me with something he was specialised in\! (Kind of like the doctor’s edition of *"if you have a hammer, everything seems like a nail")*

But after months of medical consults, self study and pure frustration, I put aside my *search for answers* and spent the remaining part of the year, and the years ahead, in doing whatever I could, to take my mind off this issue.

That search for a *distraction* somehow resulted in an increased interest in math and data science. In sifting through those concepts, I came across *Bayes Theorem*.   

## Bayes Theorem

Before we go ahead, here's a quick recap of Bayes Theorem which itself pivots on something called **conditional probability**

For any events  𝐴  and  𝐵  with positive 
probabilities,

If $A$ and $B$ are events with $P(B)\gt0$,
then the conditional probability of $A$ given $B$, denoted by $P(A| B)$, is defined as

$$P(A|B) = \frac{P(A\cap B)}{P(B)}$$

Essentially, it's how much your odds change given something happened. For a concrete example consider your odds of marrying your crush **given that** he/she was recently married. Zero no?!

If the above is clear, the road to Bayes Theorem is a stop away.

First, let's shuffle the equation to get: 

$$P(A \cap B) = P(B) P(A|B)$$

<p style="text-align: center;">And similarly</p>

$$P(A \cap B) = P(A) P(B|A)$$

<p style="text-align: center;">Hence</p>

$$P(B) P(A|B)= P(A) P(B|A)$$

And from the above, Bayes Theorem is another simple shuffle from the left numerator to the right denominator

$$P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) P(A)}{P(B)}.$$

Often it is difficult to know the *unconditional probability* of event $B$ but we can compute it easily using the Law of Total Probability [proof here]().

Let  𝐴1,…,𝐴𝑛  be a partition of the sample space  𝑆  (i.e., the  𝐴𝑖  are disjoint events and their union is  𝑆 ), with  𝑃(𝐴𝑖)>0  for all  𝑖 . Then:

$$P(B) = \sum_{i=1}^n P(B|A_i) P(A_i)$$

If the above concepts are still unclear, I suggest you read this excellent blog post([Bayes Rule and Serological Testing](https://covid19.posts.ai/2020/04/04/bayes-rule-and-serological-testing.html)) by Harvard professor and Univ.Ai founder [Dr. Rahul Dave](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dr-rahul-dave-0115364)

It requires no prior knowledge of the concepts and uses a real life case study of covid-19 serological testing to make Bayes Theorem comprehensible. 

## Hindsight 2020 but foresight Legally Blind?

Back to my story.

So now, powered with Bayes theorem, let’s fast forward to the night of **10th June 2020**, the night I was ready to tackle the question from three years ago. 

*“If roughly 90% of people were happy with the surgery, how come I landed in the wretched 10%? Why me\!”*

Time to employ conditional probability and Bayes theorem.


According to popular online reviews, approximately 90% of responders were happy with the outcome. (We assume that this is a true representation of all patients undergoing this particular surgery)

### What makes me different from the other patients?

Out of the several medics I visited, one was a pulmonologist, who magically concluded that I was asthmatic (although I had no discernible history of asthma before the operation, and I was an [active sportsperson](https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/Uploads/Goa_Upload/Goa_Media/Times-of-India_10-03-2014.pdf) throughout my graduate studies)

He based his theory on an **IgG test**, which made clear definitively that I had significant allergies.  

Many people with allergic pre-conditions are regular candidates for Septoplasty, for similar issues of breathing difficulties like my own.

The other significant group of people opting for Septoplasty are those with significant nasal deviations.

This is surprisingly not uncommon for people of the Indian subcontinent, with doctors claiming that 90% of Indians have some form of nasal deviation. (Check yourself in the mirror, your nose may be crooked too)

So we have two significant categories of surgery opters, i.e. people with allergies, and people with deviations.

To simplify the argument, let’s term people with deviations as those not having allergies, and so post-surgery, we have four categories, i.e. combinations of Unhappy/Happy, and Allergic/Not Allergic

Below is an *Emoji Matrix* that conveys the ideas.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hargun3045/blog-dump/master/bayes-images/RelationsOnly.png)

$H$ and $NH$ are the *Happy* and the *Not Happy* groups
and $A$ and $NA$ are the *Allergic* and *Not Allergic* group

In terms of probability, my problem is to find the odds of having a satisfactory result, given that I belong to the Allergic class. i.e

$$P(Happy|Allergic)$$

Employing Bayes theorem we get


$$P(Happy|Allergic) = \frac{P(Allergic/Happy)*P(Happy)}{P(Allergic)}$$

Using *Law of Total Probability* from above, we can calculate the denominator as a sum of conditional probabilities.

$$P(Happy|Allergic) = \frac{P(Allergic/Happy)*P(Happy)}{P(Allergic/Happy)*P(Happy) + P(Allergic/NotHappy)*P(NotHappy)}$$

Now, $P(Happy) = 90\%$ which we know from realself.com

From subjective reviews, it appeared that most unhappy patients had allergic pre-conditions, and most happy patients were those without discerible allergies, so we approximate

$$P(Allergic|NotHappy) = 90\%$$

$$P(Allergic|Happy)= 10\%$$ 



With those values, our *Emoji Matrix* now looks like this:

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hargun3045/blog-dump/master/bayes-images/EmojiMatrix.png)

Now, we can answer the relavent question,

$$P(Happy|Allergy) = \frac{9}{9+9} = 50\%$$

So the odds of a **happy** outcome, given that I was allergic was just about **50%** \!\!\!

At 90% it seemed like a *safe bet* to get operated.

Would I be willing to risk a medical intervention, on a sensory receptor that is responsible for a breath every other second, on just about **50%** chance of satisfaction\!?\! Will I place my odds of medical 
misery on a flip of a coin? **Absolutely not**\!

If I had such information, I’d rather be compelled to try every other possible non-invasive remedy, from yoga to a trip to the Himalayas, before taking such a leap of faith, and gamble on life-long repercussions. 

Despite the gross approximations while making the above calculation, as I was writing this post, I came across this research study from [National Center for Biotechnology Information](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19936374/) on the effects of allergies on septoplasty outcomes.

Alarmingly, the results of this detailed study had a similar conclusion to the one we made above!

### Parting thoughts

As the say, in hindsight there is clarity, but Bayes theorem gives solid lessons for the future as well. 
* **Unconditional** probabilities such as *surgery success rates*, or *mortality rates* of infections, or *average income statistics* are all a facade, and mask too much information to be of serious use.   
* It’s essential to at least try to make some ***conditional*** estimates, and carefully examine how the odds change for your specific condition **before** you take a decision.
* A second unbiased opinion, is conditional probability in action. Call it a Bayesian blessing, because you can feel more confident about your conclusions.

So next time, before you consider a hair transplant, botox or lasik surgery, and feel empowered by the stats on some websites such as [realself.com](realself.com), or [doconline.com](doconline.com), take a moment to ask yourself,   
***“Do these general statistics apply to me?”*** 

And if you don’t have a definitive answer, call a friend who scored an A grade in Stats 101 before you make a decision, or ask your mom, she may know better than Bayes.
