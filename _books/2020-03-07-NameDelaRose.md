>"In the end, I wish I knew the name of that Rose"

I first had the urge to read Umberto Eco after reading his interview published in my 12th grade English textbook. This was roughly a decade ago. Reading it had a lasting impact on me because Eco’s ideas appeared so fresh and radical. I wanted to know more about his style, his form of expression, and especially the novel that the lesson spoke about, ‘The Name of the Rose’

Unfortunately reading books has not been my key strength, as I find it difficult to have the patience to sit down for a long period of time and consume large volumes.

However, after almost ten years, I felt I should take up the challenge and take on the novel head-on, even though even in reading, I seldom like fiction. That’s when I placed the amazon order for ‘The Name of the Rose’, and within a day, I had it in my hands.

I would be lying if I said I fell in love with it from the beginning, in fact I almost considered returning it. I’ve had similar issues with fiction, like ‘The Lord of the Rings’ and ‘Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy’

Fictional volumes involve creation of new worlds, maps, different vocabulary, and this is the first thing one has to gulp down even before beginning.

But the pleasant feelings of that 12th grade lesson urged me to go through it.   
I personally didn’t care much for Tolkien or Douglas Adam, but I had an emotional connection with Eco, so I decided to soldier on.

I tried hacks, and one of the ideas I had was to see the movie first (starring the almighty Sean Connery).   
I saw the trailer, and I was like, ‘yeah, maybe I’ll watch that first’. But for some reason, I didn’t, and it was the best decision of 2020 at least\!   
Why this was the case, is the purpose of this blogpost. So let me tell you what I thought about the book (which I completed with some effort), the movie(which didn’t take any effort), and what was the lasting thought after the ordeal. Let’s go\!

**The Book**

As mentioned, the book starts really slowly. The first item to consume is the map of an ancient monastery. It’s where all the action would happen, but a 2D map seems so limited in todays world of 3D google maps\!

The basic premise is set in 12th century Italy, an age guided largely by the Roman Catholic church and a hunger for learning. We have a ‘forward-thinking’ priest as the lead, ‘William of Baskerville’ (English? Bakerstreet?), a man who starts showing his supreme powers of deduction right from page two.

There is a version of his Watson, a ‘novice’, learning from the priest, by the name of ‘Adso’, and after ‘Ancient Holmes’ shows some intellectual pony tricks, he and Adso are bestowed with the responsibility to crack the ‘murder mystery’ haunting the monastery.

Not a huge fan of ‘Sherlock Holmes’ either, I had the impression this was going to be a 12th century version of it, which didn’t seem very appealing. It did go in that direction for a long chunk of the book, with the added burden of 12th century politics, religious disharmony, stories of heretics and hints of modern thinking shown through our ‘12th century Holmes’

Luckily, I have a faint interest in medieval history, and it didn’t feel much of a struggle to learn more about the Franciscans, the Benedictines or the popular heretic ‘Fra Dolcino’. In fact, I gobbled up the diversions, because I generally do not like the artificiality of ‘logical deduction’ that many authors use to keep their audience hooked.

The book started to ‘flow’ by the half-way mark. I was enough invested with the characters, the set-ups and the ‘murders’ that now I couldn’t put the book down. That’s where I was at the mercy of Eco. He had me, and the layers of story telling had gripped me like an obsession. It did continue like the classical Holmes detective novel, but it was offering so much more\!

I reached the last chapter satisfied with the read. My respect for Eco was reinforced, and I was happy to close the book with our ‘William of Baskerville’ to nab the criminal using his supreme power of deductive reasoning alone. That’s where Eco opened the trap door on me\! The last chapter, had me falling with nothing to hold-on to\! ‘William of Baskerville’ used logical analysis, he found his ‘criminal’ but this was nothing like I had ever expected\! To give you a taste, William found the criminal by ‘serendipitous chance’ and his ‘analysis’ ultimately turned out to be ‘wasteful and misleading’(sic).

Even so, the final outcome was utter destruction as the ‘criminal’ burned down most of the monastery using the candle William brought with him\! The end of the book was so frighteningly real, with no sense of resolution, no meaning and with our hero ultimately disillusioned with his own core beliefs\! I couldn’t sleep the night I completed the book. It shook me\!   
It wasn’t like any story I had read before. It exposed me to the potential meaningless of life, and I ‘hated’ Eco but in an admiring, respectful way. It took me a lot of time to ‘snap out of it’ and for that reason, I must admit, it has been one of the most enjoyable reading experiences I’ve had so far.

To learn more about the man and his thoughts, I saw some of his interviews on youtube [(the best one)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8IWTOFNlOc). After hours of listening to him, I learned that all of those feelings I had while reading the book were intended\! Eco mentioned how he fought against his publishers to keep a dense first half of the book. An act he termed ‘Do Penitence\!’ He wanted his readers to go through all that difficult material and only the ones to survive through it would get to enjoy the spectacle of the second half. What a contrarian belief to the current ‘Give the audience what they want’

He also spoke at length about how he created the medieval world even before writing a word, by reading old chronicles, studying priests, and also designing more than fifty labyrinths by himself for only the one he had in the book.

Wholly satisfied with my undertaking, I had nothing but respect for this literary giant, who, through his book, brought such a strong emotional reaction in me, I still can’t help but ponder over it from time to time.

**The Movie**

![](/images/posts/NameDelaRose/image5.jpeg)

With a great sense of satisfaction from the book, I now decided to give the movie a try. Why wouldn’t I? I was already so involved in Eco’s universe, it didn’t hurt to spend some more time and see how ‘Hollywood’ fleshed out this beauty. How could it possibly screw it up?

Fifteen minutes in to the film, I started having a very uneasy feeling in my tummy. The film was understandably skipping parts to ‘make it more film-like’, but the movie seemed not only chopping, but ‘lobotomising’ the story\!

After that, it just kept going downhill, even when I thought it was not possible to go further. It’s as if, the writers had a mission to destroy Eco’s work in the most cruel way, and they were succeeding at doing just that\!

They even changed the meaning of the title\! Eco explained in the epilogue that the title roughly meant that although physical manifestations of roses come and go, the ‘name’ or the ‘idea’ is all that remains. It’s such a deep meaning. Think about it. You, and I, may not be there tomorrow, but our names will (hopefully) last through generations.

Here’s how the movie botched it up. Eco’s book had one ‘sex-scene’ that had ‘Adso’ (Watson) have opportune sex with a village girl. The way it was described was nice, but it had no central arching effect on the story. The book was not about that ‘sex-scene’, it was a device used to add some flavour.

But the movie decided to center itself around that ‘money-shot’, made the village girl a central character, and had the movie ending with ‘Adso’ looking at the village girl and thinking, ‘I wish I knew the name of that *Rose*’

What\! How? Can? You? Screw? This? Up?

Again I couldn’t sleep for a few nights, but this time it was out of anger. I wanted to meet the the director, the writers and the cast and castigate them, maybe throw a tomato on their face\! How could they destroy such a marvellous piece of literature in such an extraordinary fashion?\! It was beyond me. I could only feel lucky that I didn’t start with this garbage because it would have destroyed how I experienced the book.

**Summary**

To sum it up, my feeling of euphoria on reading the book, could only be matched by the feeling of sheer anger on seeing the movie.

I understand that films are a different medium, but my complain is not with the shortening of the plot, or adaptation to the ‘big screen’. It’s that the writers didn’t have the sense to at least respect the spirit of the book. I believe they owe this much to the author, to adapt the story, but in its element, without twisting the underlying ideas just to suit the audience.   
The movie is everything the book aims not to be. I am sure this was not the first time this has happened, and it won’t be the last time. On researching this article, I came across a television adaptation which I am yet to see. I am skeptical about it, but I hope the writers are a little more sensible this time.

To sum up, I highly recommend you take a dive in Eco’s universe. Agreed you will have to ‘do penitence’ and go through some difficult reading before you start enjoying it, but Eco will be there in the end to absolve you of your initial struggle and make it all worth it\!

Book 10/10

Movie: 0/10
