The ‘novel’ coronavirus i.e **COVID-19** is the new villain of our lives, rampaging across cities, infecting everyone in its path. This has naturally lead to paranoia across all nationalities with people stocking up on masks, sanitisers and among other things, ‘toilet paper’

It’s not without reason though, the disease has three fear-inducing characteristics.

1.  It’s contagious (human-to-human spread through infected droplets of bodily fluids)

2.  It has a higher than average mortality rate compared to other coronaviruses like influenza. (ten times more likely to kill)

3.  We have no known vaccination or specific medication (We just have to trust our immune system to flush it out)

With 92,000+ infected globally and a death tally of more than 3000, the mortality rate currently is around 3.4% but that may change with time with more infections.

In response to it, draconian measures are taken around the world, starting right from a lockdown of the epicentre in Wuhan, to corporates and governments cancelling mass-gathering events, Google has already it’s annual ‘I/O’ conference and voices to postpone the Olympics in Japan are growing louder.

It’s not just big name event cancellations, a lot of funds are pouring in to take health and economic measures. World Bank pledged 12 billion dollars to aide developing countries, Amazon founder CEO Jeff Bezos alone pledged 10 billion dollars\!

It is impressive to see that governing bodies across the globe are responding so swiftly and literally throwing such large sums of money at the problem. Such funding is only as good as the labs it supports, and those will take their own time to find a cure.

But until then, a different question begs to be asked. If all these governing bodies have such an enormous financial capacity to pledge billions of dollars for the ‘better health of the people’,    
**why on Earth have we not tackled other prevelant and far more threatening issues with the same enthusiasm and zeal?**

## 21st century "Silent Assassin"
To begin with, let’s talk about carbon emissions and polluted air. There has been significant evidence linking rising pollution levels and general morbidity (
[Over 100,000 deaths in 29 indian cities due to air pollution](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/over-1-lakh-deaths-in-29-cities-due-to-air-pollution-study/articleshow/74144139.cms)), and other serious conditions such as diabetes and obesity. ([Study links air pollution to obesity in young adults](https://airqualitynews.com/2019/11/01/air-pollution-linked-to-obesity-in-young-adults/)) Chronic exposure to polluted air is the number one silent killer across the globe and a recent study by Financial Times estimated that the measures against spread of coronavirus reduced carbon emissions in China by 200 metric tonnes in the last 4 weeks alone\! That is the total amount of emissions per year by developed nations like Netherlands or Ukraine.

So although 3000 plus deaths paints a grim picture on the virus, if we take into account all causes of mortality, we may expect to see a ‘drop’ in overall mortality rates.

Mortality due to pollution is not only restricted to breathing poor quality air. Known causes of poor health conditions are linked to consumption of polluted water, or fish with traces of waste plastic, or vegetables with excessive pesticides.
And even today, the number one global killing machine remains to be ‘Malaria’, a vector disease spread by mosquitos breading in stagnant water. All these ‘unpopular’ but lethal agents are still out there, potentially taking away thousands of lives, or at the very least endanger the quality of life of millions.

Some people may take the above argument to play down the dangers of coronavirus. That’s not the point here. The virus is deadly and needs to be dealt with, and all authorities are going out of their way to deal with it. But the intensity of our response does beg the question, where was all this effort before?



## Urban Perils

Another rampant killer round the corner is a road accident. Often, in the wake of deadly plane crashes, statisticians love to cite the lack of road safety with the phrase **‘You are many more times likely to die in a road accident than a flight crash’**
But what about the reverse question. Is the high mortality rate on roads just because of crazy humans? Are we ‘all’ such terrible drivers that we’re worse than an autopilot of a plane nose-diving even when [actual pilots tried to steer it up?](https://globalnews.ca/news/5049364/boeing-737-max-8-autopilot-problem/)

Especially in developing countries, quality of roads is seldom taken as a priority issue. Leaving the working class to suffer daily. At worst there is a risk of death to due road accident, but it’s not all roses otherwise either. On the flip side, poorly planned and under-quality roads often translate to longer commute time, meaning you’re there inhaling toxic gases and each time you hit a pothole, your body gets a shock concentrated on your lower back and knees, making them wear out quicker.

A risk to public health due to lack of planning is not only restricted to roads.  
Currently, in any country, most well paying corporate offices are unhealthily concentrated in select cities because of government provided subsidies. This bottlenecks a large population in search of good employment prospects to such cities, leading to unnatural depletion of natural resources and swift but unmonitored construction projects, causing poor quality of air and water. 

No wonder people in these cities are sicker than average. I, myself, am a victim of this. After my graduation, I moved to Bangalore, the ‘silicon valley’ of India. But despite being an avid sportsperson in college, I developed severe breathing difficulties after a couple of years in the new city. This had less to do with my ‘pre-existing conditions’ than the conditions caused by my existence in this city feared to be [unliveable by 2025](https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2017/mar/01/burning-lakes-experts-fear-bangalore-uninhabitable-2025)

![](/images/posts/covid/image7.jpeg)

This is a failure of **policy**, not *‘greed’* of corporates or people trying to make a living. 
We are living longer, but sicker, and this is not just a consequence of our individual decisions, but also a result of the environment around us. 

## What about the differently-abled?

As we speak of general health, it is imperative to also mention the daily struggles of the ‘differently’ abled people. Apart from a few corporate efforts and Non Governmental Organisations, we have had a tone deaf attitude toward people with some form of disability. As a graduation project, I had the chance to visit government facilities for the development of prosthetic solutions and I was appalled by the limited amount of funding provided for design improvements.   
In fact, India’s largest provider for upper-limb prosthetics still provides a design from world war two\! 
In the recent years, it took a college-drop out to actually sit down and improve the existing design. [Prashant Gade](https://www.linkedin.com/in/prashant-gade-88718457/?originalSubdomain=in)

People with disabilities struggle each day to lead a ‘normal’ life, and a conversation with any of them is enough to fill you all the inspiration you need. But do we really need them to struggle for such simple pleasures? Is it necessary for their life to be so miserable?   

In an chance airplane conversation with [Moses Gorrepati](https://www.linkedin.com/in/moses-gorrepati-30849172/?originalSubdomain=in), a program manager from ENABLE India, who himself was without the gift of vision, I could hear his frustration when he mentioned that some parents in Indian villages tie their blind kids because they’re afraid of the child's well-being. Imagine being tied up all day on your bed, just because your parents don’t know any better way to let you enjoy the world.

Why wouldn’t the governing bodies start a pervasive campaign to bring awareness of existing solutions? This doesn’t even need a funding in research and development. The solutions are there\! Do we need the frenzy that this ‘novel’ virus brings each time to see effective action?

## Final Thoughts

To sum up, I am very impressed that over overseers are taking such effective measures to contain such a potent threat. But on second thought, I hope this is not influenced largely by public frenzy.

If our policy makers, irrespective of country or region, are genuinely committed to improving overall public well-being, they should continue investing in measures that curb all types of pollution, improve the state of public utilities and make better and more inclusive policy, be it concerning health, finance, or infrastructure.   
The prudent action toward COVID-19 is evidence that authorities across the world have the funds and capacity to take big challenges head-on. So what will be their excuse to overlook other,less popular but equally menacing issues?

And to those still worried about COVID-19, let me quote an experienced doctor who shared an amusing pithy when I enquired of him on the subject.

**Young… Healthy… Fit??\!\! Just forget corona… Have Corona 😋**
